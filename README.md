## Projects
*I like seeing things working.*

- Documentation Page
It's a documentation page that had the design based off of [Veeam's User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/vsphere/overview.html?ver=120).
I used raw html/css/js to make it, and markdown to html for the pages.
- [Stock Control](https://github.com/angeluciel/pac_controle-de-emprestimos)
For the stock control we used vue.js and node.
The packages for node were the following:

```
npm install express mysql2 sequelize jsonwebtoken bcryptjs dotenv
```
